			<p>I graduated in 2016 with a BA in Computer Science from Southwestern University, and I have 2+ years of work experience in Java, Javascript, PHP, and React at <a href="https://kibocommerce.com/" style="color:#FECE00">Kibo</a>. Kibo provides cloud commerce solutions for manufacturers and brands to be able to sell their products and thrive online.</p>
			<p>I enjoy coding as a hobby as well as my job, and I'm always available to answer questions if you're interested in Computer Science or programming as well! Check my <a href="/contact">Contact section</a> to get in touch with me.</p> 
			<p>I have a lot of art-based hobbies; traditional and digital art, acrylic panting, sculpting, etc. I do take art commissions, but please check my <a href="">Trello art tracker</a> to see if I'm available for commissions.</p>
			<p>I've been involved in a variety of creative projects and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and improve my skills. Thank you for your interest and thank you for visiting my site!</p>
