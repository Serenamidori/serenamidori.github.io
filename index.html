			Hello! I'm Gabriela Rica Gonzalez, and I go by Gab.<br>
			I'm 24, I'm a lady, and I love coding and graphic design. I have BA in Computer Science from Southwestern University, as well as work experience in Java and PHP from Kibo Commerce.<br>
			I've been involved in a variety of creative projects and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and improve my skills. I work well in teams and often take up leadership roles, I'm not afraid to take charge when things need to get done!
