              Hello, I'm <span class="emphasis">Gabby</span> :)
            </h1>
            <p class="mt-3">Thanks for stopping by my site, hope you like what you find!</p>
            <p class="mt-3">I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for front-end design and dedication to always keep learning. I've worked in a variety of different industries from eCommerce to health care, and I'm keen on expanding my horizons.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Practically growing up using a computer, you might think it'd be inevitable that I'd turn to coding. However, aside from the occasional HTML profile code, it really wasn't until I was already in college that I considered it. My professor at the time asked me, "why don't you do this?" in reference to not only my major, but my profession in life. And that question has stuck with me. <span class="emphasis">Yeah, why <i>don't</i> I do this?</span>
