            <p class="mt-3">I practically grew up using a computer, and one might think that it'd be inevitable for me to turn to coding. However, it  wasn't until I was already in college that I considered it. I have always had a passion for art and had considered myself a more creative person than a logical one. I understand now how silly it was to limit myself, but at the time my first Computer Science class was daunting. In the end, I had a blast learning with Java and really excelled where I thought I'd fail. Towards the end of that semester, my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-denman-b13b097/" target="_blank">professor</a> asked me, "why don't you do this?" in regards to my major. And that question has stuck with me my entire career; <span class="emphasis">Yeah, why <i>don't</i> I do this?</span></p>
