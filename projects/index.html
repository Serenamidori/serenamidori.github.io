	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>
		Here are various projects I've worked on, with groups and on my own, that I'm proud of. They allow me to sharpen my skills while working on something I love.

            <h3>Werewolf Helper App</h3>
            <b>Ruby on Rails Web App</b><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/Serenamidori/werewolf-app"><span class="fa fa-github-square" aria-hidden="true"></span> GitHub Repository</a><br>
            Solo project, for fun, front end development, MVC, and Javascript<br>
            The idea for this app came to me when my friends, whom I'd speak to online via Skype, expressed wanting to play new games besides those available online. I had previously purchased a version of the card game, Werewolf, and decided we could attempt to play that, if I were to type out the cards, their names, roles, etc. and simply send each friend their roles via private messaging on Skype. I realized that this was sadly very inefficient and wished there would be an easier way to, not only make new decks on my own, but allow my friends to be the moderator by giving them a tool to easy create a deck and shuffle it to the players.<br>
